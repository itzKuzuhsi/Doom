**So what _is_ Doom Emacs?** It’s a configuration framework for [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) tailored for experienced Emacs users, who want:

- An Emacs Lisp framework that doesn’t abstract Emacs away,
- A reproducible, shell-scriptable package manager with disaster recovery built-in,
- The performance of a hand-rolled config or better,
- And batteries included, _but only where you want them to be._
- A framework or a starter kit (what’s the difference?)

It can be a foundation for your own config (with as many – or as few – batteries included as you like), a reference for enthusiasts building their own, or anywhere in between.

**Why was Doom written?** Picture this. The year is 2014. A spry, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic hellspawn from the frigid [North](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Canada/@54.723477,-113.7170394,4z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4b0d03d337cc6ad9:0x9968b72aa2438fa5!8m2!3d56.130366!4d-106.346771) lays his tired eye on his old friend of 12 years – Vim – and for the last time. He is exhausted. He would not wish VimScript on even the Doom slayer himself, but like any good agent of evil he wants _more power_; he wants a better Vim than Vim.

So he visits every contemporary editor you can name, but their Vim plugins disappoint him to the point of desperation.

Henrik Lissner, a Canadian/Danish devops engineer and gamedev hobbyist. After 12 years as an avid Vim user (and a brief stint with every contemporary editor you can name), he discovered Emacs, then [Evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil "Opens the homepage for the \"), and was convinced he’d found a better Vim than Vim. Though, the Vim plugins of said contemporary text editors had likely disappointed him to the point of desperation, and he’d already begun wondering where his life had gone so, so wrong.

Still, in a perilous effort to learn Emacs and Emacs Lisp, he tinkered away. The year is 2014, and that config would later become Doom Emacs.
- **Its package manager.** Stop micromanaging your plugins and fighting Emacs’ rolling-release package manager. Doom’s is declarative, non-rolling release, and (nominally) reproducible; which is unique on the Emacs starter-kit scene. Don’t let upstream issues surprise you. Roll back or re-pin packages when you don’t have the time to deal with issues. Wield precise control over your packages.
    
    It also integrates with command line workflows, so automate to your heart’s content.
    
- **To save time.** If you care about personalizing the software you use on a daily basis, even half as much as I do, then you need professional help, but you also know it is time consuming. Emacs out-of-the-box is a wasteland of archaic defaults, full of plugins rife with gotchas and oddities that may or may not be abandonware. It will be an uphill battle. Let Doom deal with all that noise to save yourself some time.
    
    Time you could otherwise spend attending your daughter’s dance recitals, that baseball game your son’s team almost won last Thursday, or answering the court summons to fight for custody of your kids.
    
- **It’s a gentler introduction to Emacs.** Emacs is hard™. Doom files down its rougher edges.
- **Emacs is slow.** Doom can’t promise to resolve _all_ Emacs’ performance issues, but it certainly helps, and it will always be a priority.
- **It can be a barebones framework.** Disable all its modules and you get many of Doom’s perks without its opinions; why go vanilla when you can have vanilla + better defaults + a stronger elisp toolchain from the get go?

What it can do for you

- Better defaults.
- Faster baseline.
- Pre-configured modules.


##### Why _not_ Doom?

- You believe Doom is a barrier to learning Emacs underneath.
- You have an Emacs config that you’re happy with and don’t have the time/energy to migrate.
