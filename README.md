The previous section established Emacs’ strengths and weaknesses, so where does Doom Emacs come in? Doom is a configuration for Emacs meant to address many of its issues, especially those concerning performance, but why exactly should someone use it?

- **Its package manager.** Stop micromanaging your plugins and fighting Emacs’ rolling-release package manager. Doom’s is declarative, non-rolling release, and (nominally) reproducible; which is unique on the Emacs starter-kit scene. Don’t let upstream issues surprise you. Roll back or re-pin packages when you don’t have the time to deal with issues. Wield precise control over your packages.
    
    It also integrates with command line workflows, so automate to your heart’s content.
    
- **To save time.** If you care about personalizing the software you use on a daily basis, even half as much as I do, then you need professional help, but you also know it is time consuming. Emacs out-of-the-box is a wasteland of archaic defaults, full of plugins rife with gotchas and oddities that may or may not be abandonware. It will be an uphill battle. Let Doom deal with all that noise to save yourself some time.
    
    Time you could otherwise spend attending your daughter’s dance recitals, that baseball game your son’s team almost won last Thursday, or answering the court summons to fight for custody of your kids.
    
- **It’s a gentler introduction to Emacs.** Emacs is hard™. Doom files down its rougher edges.
- **Emacs is slow.** Doom can’t promise to resolve _all_ Emacs’ performance issues, but it certainly helps, and it will always be a priority.
- **It can be a barebones framework.** Disable all its modules and you get many of Doom’s perks without its opinions; why go vanilla when you can have vanilla + better defaults + a stronger elisp toolchain from the get go?

What it can do for you

- Better defaults.
- Faster baseline.
